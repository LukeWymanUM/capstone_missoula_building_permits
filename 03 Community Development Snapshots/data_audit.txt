The purpose of this file is to do an audit of how the dashboard differs from
the workbook. First, I will explain issues in the workbook I see and then will 
jump into the month-by-month audit comparing results.

There is an issue with the "Oct Report" sheet in all of the workbooks. If you 
look at cells J37, J39, and J41, you will see incorrect cell references. This
leads to underreporting of revenue, as the YTD calculation is missing October
Building, Plumbing, and Demoliion Revenue. So, the following info shows how
much revenue is missing from the YTD roll-up due to this issue:

Oct 2021 Building: $159,537.00
Oct 2021 Plumbing: $17,128.00
Oct 2021 Demolition: $95.00

Oct 2022 Building: $118,716.55
Oct 2022 Plumbing: $12,685.00
Oct 2022 Demolition: $114.00

Oct 2023 Building: $64,271.39
Oct 2023 Plumbing: $20,378.00
Oct 2023 Demolition: $57.00

Oct 2024 Building: $140,091.51
Oct 2024 Plumbing: $10,760.00
Oct 2024 Demolition: $21.00
