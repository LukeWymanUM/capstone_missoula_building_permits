Property was purchased in 2015 as a house and a garage with a apartment above (according to MLS description it was previously rented and also used as an owner business later).  Upon looking into permits further it appears the garage was permitted as a ""garage with storage unit"".  This permit is to change the use from storage unit to ADU and to resolve any expired issues with the original permits.   Apartment is already finished (plumbed and wired) as well as garage is plumbed and wired but does not yet have any wall coverings.  I have talked with Engineering and understand the driveway approach and driveway to garage doors will need to paved and I have started making plans to have that project completed.  Attached is the original building permit as well as a current floor plan that shows the locations of the sinks (sinks where listed on the plumbing permit but never drawn on the plans).  Please contact me at the listed phone number or email if any further information is needed.",OWNER,12000.0,0.0,,,755 BURTON ST,ADU,12000.0,0.0,ADU,New Construction,99.0,0,08 Data Dump,2023-08-01,August,08,2023,2024
