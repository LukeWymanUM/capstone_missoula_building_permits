# Building Permit Operational Insights Dashboard

![Building Permit Operational Insights Dashboard](../resources/02_dashboard.png)

This dashboard contains many of the same insights as the building permit metrics dashboard. However, the objective of this dashboard is to provide operational insights to the city during the building permit review process, enabling them to identify areas for improvement and optimize workflows. The dashboard offers a more comprehensive view of the permit application process, including information about which permit processes could be leading to more or longer reviews.

By analyzing these metrics and trends, the city can gain a deeper understanding of the operational dynamics at play and make informed decisions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the permitting process. They can find historical trends in permit quanities and review quantities and allocate resources more effectively.

This dashboard is intended for internal stakeholders, such as city officials, permit reviewers, and other personnel involved in the permitting process. By providing a detailed and nuanced view of the permitting process, the dashboard can help them improve their process.
