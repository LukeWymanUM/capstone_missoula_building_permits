### Dashboard Types
Snapshot Dashboards
* Summarizes data at a moment in time.
* Can be used to tell a story or make a claim.
* The purpose is to inform, explain, pursuade, and analyze.
* Color is used for branding and/or to emphasize important data points.

Monitoring Dashboards
* Updates on dynamic data, updating intermittenly or regularly.
* Often can't tell a story, since it is changing.
* You can, however, draw attention to values of interest by highlighting / conditional formatting and color.
* The purpose is to inform, flag concerns, evaluate performance, analyze, and provide status updates.

### Deployment Patterns

Web Apps <- Dashboard <- Web Maps <- Feature Layers -> Mobile Apps

### Requirements Gathering / Questions to aask

Technology
* AGOL vs. Enterprise
* Does the data exist to support the dashboard?
* How often is the data updated? By whom?
* How should metrics be represented in the dashboard?

People
* Whoe is the audience?
* Public vs. Internal?
* How will the end users be using the dashboard?
* Is the audience technical?
* Knowledge transfer / documentation needed

Process
* Does the customer already have an app they want to turn into dashboard?
* What questions should this help answer?
* Is this part of a bigger workflow?

General 
* Does the customer need to have branding?
* Do any artifacts exist?
* Does the dashboard need a map?
* What are the cartography requirements?

### Data Preparation

* What types of data issues have you encountered?
* When were the issues discovered? How did you discover it?
* What was the solution?

### Solution Diagrams

These can be helpful for managing your layers. You want to have a map of how data flows between dashboards and layers to best identify any issues that may come up.
