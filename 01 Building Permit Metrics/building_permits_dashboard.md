The primary objective of the CPDI Building Permit Metrics dashboard is to provide transparency and insights into the permit application process. This is achieved through several key purposes, including fully automating visualizations of permit processing times, volumes, and types, which enables stakeholders to track trends and identify areas for improvement. 

Additionally, the dashboard utilizes an automated data pipeline to extract data from back-end SQL database tables and transform it into datasets ideal for visualization. By making these metrics publicly accessible, the dashboard allows stakeholders to be better informed about the permitting process, fostering a more open and accountable system. 

Overall, the CPDI Building Permit Metrics dashboard is a valuable resource that harnesses the power of data visualization to drive transparency, accountability, and improvement in the permitting process, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and understanding of the process.
